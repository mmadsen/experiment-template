# README for experiment creation #

This script, and the template directory in the main directory, requires customization
for your project.  The create-experiment-directory.sh script copies files and creates
a directory structure, all of which need to be customized for the task at hand.  

Use this script, and the template directory above, as a structure.  There is no such
thing as a fully generic experiment, so treat this as a starting point!
