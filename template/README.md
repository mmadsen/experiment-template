# REPLACEME #

Composed of:

* 15 slices in the same 10K steps, to see if having shorter durations and then sampling the assemblages changes our ability to detect structure
* Hierarchy with 4 children per level
* Root node which can change over time, with 0.2 prob per slice
* Very weak links between nodes, except for strong links between lowest level (gchild) nodes
* Low innovation rate prior distribution (theta = 0.0005 to 0.001)
* Low migration fraction prior distribution (migr = 0.005 to 0.01)
