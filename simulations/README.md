# Simulation Management #



## EC2 Information ##

The current simulation platform is EC2 AMI:  ami-e752418e   
This AMI is private currently.  

This AMI has Anaconda python 2.7, mongodb, R, and checked out clones of several of my Github projects.  
It also has a copy of Brendan MacKay's "nauty+Traces" program installed, to facilitate graph
automorphism calculations.  

The root drive is very small, but there is a 100GB partition mounted at /mnt, and all work should be 
done there.
